7169,Pancakes,"This is one of my adopted recipes. I adopted it towards the end of 2005 because it brought back many happy memories. I have altered it just a little by using melted butter in place of the shortening and by mixing the egg, milk & butter together before adding to the dry ingredients.  I have also added how to cook them for those new to cooking :)  My Mother In Law used to make pancakes for my girls when they were young as a treat when we visited. They always had them with lemon juice (she had a wonderful large lemon tree) and sprinkled them with sugar.  :)
The cooking time is approximate.

If you don't have your starter yet, plan on this several days in advance, so you have time to make the starter (which is very easy!). These pancakes are slightly thin, so if you want them thicker, add a little flour until you get the consistency you like.

This recipe has been in my husband's family for years (hubby's grandparents were from Switzerland.) When my in-laws prepare these, the pancakes are folded up without any filling but I take it a step further and add all sorts of goodies, depending on the season (read my suggestions below).
