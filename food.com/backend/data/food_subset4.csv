51092,Shredded Sweet Potato Pudding,"When I first saw this recipe demonstrated on a cooking program on Food Network, I had to copy it down to try for Thanksgiving. I have since made this several times for holiday meals and received many compliments. I have to warn you - this is no diet dish. This is very rich and very,very sweet. Even though this is sweet enough to be a dessert, this is meant to be a side dish to compliment a saltier main dish - such as a baked ham. I imagine you could try using shredded carrots as well, but I have yet to do so. (Adapted from ""Calling all Cooks"" where this was called Mama Lane's Sweet Potato Pudding and was shared guest Jim Brown.) Servings are all relative to how big a portion your guests scoop up - some years I have had less yield.

51081,My O My.. Best Thai Beef Salad Ever!,"This is one of the best Thai salads I have ever tasted and I just had to share it with my zaar family. Try it, you won't regret it. You can substitute the beef with the same amount of Pork fillets, chicken breasts or thigh fillets, or some firm tofu. When preparing this salad in advance, cook the beef, prepare the salad, and make the dressing, BUT STORE EACH IN SEPARATE CONTAINERS. Do NOT combine until you are ready to serve.

50371,Dad's Lasagna,"Like my father's rib recipe which I've also posted, this is a recipe which some old buddies of mine recently requested that I post. Back when we all were a little younger, the guys used to come over everytime my Dad made his lasagne. Maybe it was the free meal or maybe it was just that good but this recipe is the reason why lasagna has always been one of my favorite foods.
